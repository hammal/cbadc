"""
Several software/hardware simulation data classes.

The examples provided in this module provide quick access to
simulated control signal sequences from hardware prototypes.
Additionally, as simulating a control-bounded ADC is typically
a computationally intense task, compared to filtering, several
control signal sequences from default architectures and
parametrizations are provided to reduce simulation time.
