"""Analog System and Digital Control Simulator

This module provides simulator tools to simulate the hardware
interaction between an analog system and digital control.
These are mainly intended to produce control signals
:math:`\mathbf{s}[k]` and evaluate state vector trajectories
:math:`\mathbf{x}(t)` for various Analog system
:py:class:`cbadc.analog_system.AnalogSystem` and
:py:class:`cbadc.digital_control.DigitalControl` interactions.
