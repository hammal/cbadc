Simulations

In this section we share control-bounded converter simulation data.
The main motivation, being that: software simulation is time consuming 
and to provide several hardware generated control signal sequences for
comparison and benchmarking.

Many of converter examples provided here are directly taken from, or inspired by, the examples
provided in the PhD dissertation
`Control-Bounded Converters <https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/469192/control-bounded_converters_a_dissertation_by_hampus_malmberg.pdf>`_.

==================
Helper Class's API
==================

Most of the simulations are wrapped in base classes
to simplify initialization and the retrieval of data.
These base classes are described below.

Here follows examples demonstrating how to quickly load and use the pre-simulated data.
