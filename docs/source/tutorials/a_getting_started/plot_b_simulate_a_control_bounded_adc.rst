   :alt: The chain of integrators ADC.

First, we have to decide on an analog system. For this tutorial, we will
commit to a chain-of-integrators ADC,
see :py:class:`cbadc.analog_system.ChainOfIntegrators`, as our analog
system.

The Digital Control
-------------------

In addition to the analog system, our simulation will require us to specify a
digital control. For this tutorial, we will use
:py:class:`cbadc.digital_control.DigitalControl`.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-62

.. code-block:: default


    # Set the time period which determines how often the digital control updates.
    T = 1.0 / (2 * beta)
    # Set the number of digital controls to be same as analog states.
    M = N
    # Initialize the digital control.
    digital_control = cbadc.digital_control.DigitalControl(T, M)
    # print the digital control to verify proper initialization.
    print(digital_control)

    M = 6,
    and next update at
    t = 8e-05

The Analog Signal
-----------------

The final and third component of the simulation is an analog signal.
For this tutorial, we will choose a
:py:class:`cbadc.analog_signal.Sinusodial`. Again, this is one of several
possible choices.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-87

.. code-block:: default


    # Set the peak amplitude.
    amplitude = 0.5
    # Choose the sinusodial frequency via an oversampling ratio (OSR).
    OSR = 1 << 9
    frequency = 1.0 / (T * OSR)

    # We also specify a phase an offset these are hovewer optional.
    phase = np.pi / 3
    offset = 0.0

    # Instantiate the analog signal
    analog_signal = cbadc.analog_signal.Sinusodial(
        amplitude, frequency, phase, offset)
    # print to ensure correct parametrization.
    print(analog_signal)

Simulating
-------------

Next, we set up the simulator. Here we use the
:py:class:`cbadc.simulator.StateSpaceSimulator` for simulating the
involved differential equations as outlined in
:py:class:`cbadc.analog_system.AnalogSystem`.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-119

    size = 1 << 18

        analog_system, digital_control, [analog_signal], t_stop=end_time
    )
    # Depending on your analog system the step above might take some time to
    # compute as it involves precomputing solutions to initial value problems.

    # Let's print the first 20 control decisions.
    index = 0
    for s in cbadc.utilities.show_status(simulator):
        if index > 19:
            break
        print(f"step:{index} -> s:{np.array(s)}")
        index += 1

Tracking the Analog State Vector
--------------------------------

Clearly the output type of the generator simulator above is the sequence of
control signals s[k]. Sometimes we are interested in also monitoring the
internal states of analog system during simulation.

To this end we use the
:func:`cbadc.simulator.StateSpaceSimulator.state_vector` and an
:func:`cbadc.simulator.extended_simulation_result`.

Note that the :func:`cbadc.simulator.extended_simulation_result` is
defined like this

.. code-block:: python

  def extended_simulation_result(simulator):
      for control_signal in simulator:
          analog_state = simulator.state_vector()
          yield {
              'control_signal': np.array(control_signal),
              'analog_state': np.array(analog_state)
          }

So, in essence, we are creating a new generator from the old with an extended
output.

.. note:: The convenience function extended_simulation_result is one of many
          such convenience functions found in the
          :py:mod:`cbadc.simulator` module.

We can achieve this by appending yet another generator to the control signal
stream as:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 153-165

.. code-block:: default


    # Repeating the steps above we now get for the following
    # ten control cycles.

    ext_simulator = cbadc.simulator.extended_simulation_result(simulator)
    for res in cbadc.utilities.show_status(ext_simulator):
        if index > 29:
            break
        print(
            f"step:{index} -> s:{res['control_signal']}, x:{res['analog_state']}")
        index += 1

Saving to File
--------------------------------

In general, simulating the analog system and digital control interaction
is a computationally much more intense procedure compared to the digital
estimation step. This is one reason, and there are more, why
you would want to store the intermediate control signal sequence to a file.

For this purpose use the
:func:`cbadc.utilities.control_signal_2_byte_stream` and
:func:`cbadc.utilities.write_byte_stream_to_file` functions.

Evaluating the Analog State Vector in Between Control Signal Samples
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If we wish to simulate the analog state vector trajectory between
control updates, this can be achieved using the Ts parameter of the
:py:class:`cbadc.simulator.StateSpaceSimulator`. Technically you can scale
:math:`T_s = T / \alpha` for any positive number :math:`\alpha`. For such a
scaling, the simulator will generate :math:`\alpha` more control signals per
unit of time. However, digital control is still restricted to only update
the control signals at multiples of :math:`T`.

Analog State Statistics
------------------------------------------------------------------

As in the previous section, visualizing the analog state trajectory is a
good way of identifying problems and possible errors. Another way of making
sure that the analog states remain bounded is to estimate their
corresponding densities (assuming i.i.d samples).
