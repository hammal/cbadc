Next follows three basic examples demonstrating how to

1. simulate analog system and digital control interactions,
2. estimate samples :math:`\hat{\mathbf{u}}(t)` from control signals :math:`\mathbf{s}[k]`,
3. and evaluate and visualize transfer functions from analog systems and digital estimators.
